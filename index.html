            Blessing in my live, i served in the Venezuela Caracas Mission From 2020 to 2022, it has also been the
            best experience that i ever had in my life.
        </p>
        <p>I love Technology since i was a Kid, specially Videogames and Graphic Design... I wanted to study Software
            Development because i see it like a blank canvas, where we can do whatever we imagine.
